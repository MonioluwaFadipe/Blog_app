# Blog_app

Blog_app is a project I created as the examination for my second semester at [Altschool Africa](https://altschoolafrica.com/).

The application allows anyone to read blog posts made by different users. You can also register as a new user to Create, Read, Update, and Delete your posts. The authentication system setup prevents non-users from doing all these. 

## Required Packages

I have stored all the packages I used in a requirements.txt file. You can install them on your machine using Python's package manager.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
To prevent complications, I'll advise that you install these packages in a virtual environment. 

To create a virtual environment using Python, pip install virtualenv and then run;
```bash
python -m venv <virtual-environment-name>

```


## Usage
To clone this project;

```python
$ git clone https://github.com/MonioluwaFadipe/Blog_app

```


## Contributing
I'll be hoping to modify this project in the future and add more functionalities to it. If you want to contribute to this project in any way, do well to make a pull request.


## 
I've come this far with the project thanks to amazing resources on the internet and the guidance I've received. Big S/O to Caleb Emelike (the Python instructor at Altschool Africa) for the explanations during classes.
