# Blog_app

Blog_app is a project I created as the examination for my second semester at [Altschool Africa](https://altschoolafrica.com/).

The application allows anyone to read blog posts made by different users. You can also register as a new user to Create, Read, Update, and Delete your posts. The authentication system setup prevents non-users from doing all these. 

## Required Packages

I have stored all the packages I used in a requirements.txt file. You can install them on your machine using Python's package manager.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```
To prevent complications, I'll advise that you install these packages in a virtual environment. 

To create a virtual environment using Python, pip install virtualenv and then run;
```bash
python -m venv <virtual-environment-name>

```


## Usage
To clone this project;

```python
$ git clone https://github.com/MonioluwaFadipe/Blog_app

```
To run this project from your end, run;
```bash
python run.py

```
